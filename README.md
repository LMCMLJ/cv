I am an excited young junior developer about to enter the world of professional development. Until now, I have been using my coding skills to contribute to various open source projects, including leading the creation of carbonsource, a project in it's early stages that aims to promote environmental accountability among politicians (something woefully nonexistant these days).

I have just graduated from one of Europe's leading development bootcamps, [Maker's Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and am now looking for a role as a Junior Developer. I love working as part of a team, and would like to work in an organisation that actively embraces practices such as Agile and pair programming.

## Skills
I love working as part of a team, and have even had the chance to lead several development teams in the past. I consider Agile methodologies, TDD and pair programming central to writing good code and delivering value.

### Yelp clone

<->

<!-- Makers-yelp is a functionality clone of yelp. I developed it with 3 other junior developers over the course of 5 days. We wrote it in ruby and used all of the standard rails technologies. Our project was written tests-first, and we had extensive unit and feature testing with Rspec and cucumber/ capybara. Check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersyelp). -->

### Airbnb clone

<->

<!-- Makersbnb is a functionality clone of airbnb. It allows users to sign up, create and edit property listings, and request to book other users' listings. I developed this project in 5 days with 3 other junior developers. For our tech stack, we opted to go with node, express and ejs. Our database runs on postgres, and our testing was done with jasmine. Check out the final product [here](http://makersbnb2016.herokuapp.com/home) and the code itself [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersbnb). -->

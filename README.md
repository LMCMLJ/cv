## Profile
I am a passionate creator. My whole life I have been inspired and driven by creation. More than anything, I love seeing something I put thought and effort into become a material achievement. This is what first brought me to try coding 12 months ago, and since then I haven't stopped. I am driven by my desire to learn, and in just the span of 12 months have managed to pick up a breadth of knowledge.

## Skills
Having spent 16 weeks at Maker's Academy bootcamp, I have picked up many of the skills necessary to be a developer. Here are some example projects that showcase these skills:

### Yelp clone


### Airbnb clone
Makersbnb is a functionality clone of the core functionalities of airbnb. It allows users to sign up, create and edit property listings, and request to book other users' listings. I developed this project in 5 days with 3 other junior developers. For our tech stack, we opted to go with node, express and ejs. Our database runs on postgres, and our testing was done with jasmine
Check out the final product [here](http://makersbnb2016.herokuapp.com/home) and the code itself [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersbnb).

## Profile
I am a passionate creator. My whole life I have been inspired and driven by creation. More than anything, I love seeing something I put thought and effort into become a material achievement. This is what first brought me to try coding 12 months ago, and since then I haven't stopped. I am driven by my desire to learn, and in just the span of 12 months have managed to pick up a breadth of knowledge.

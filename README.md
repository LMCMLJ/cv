I am an enthusiastic young software fanatic seeking to enter the world of professional development.  Until now, I have been using my coding skills to contribute to various open source projects, including FloatingPoint, a virtual reality city-building game, and "carbonsource", an early-stage project that aims to promote environmental accountability among politicians (woefully scarce!).

I have just graduated from one of Europe's leading development bootcamps, [Maker's Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), and am now looking for a full-time or part-time role as a Junior Developer.

## Skills


Broad experience with advanced software craftsmanship principles and project management techniques. Backend language experience includes Ruby and Javascript, as well as a good understanding of HTML and CSS for the frontend. Hands-on experience developing and deploying full stack web applications, as well as minor experience with server infrastructure and hosting. Took initiative and played one of the leading roles on team-based projects (including FloatingPoint and carbonsource).

#### Agile/ XP

Throughout the last 6 months I have been involved in numerous projects following Agile and Extreme Programming methodologies, including being the SCRUM team leader in projects such as FloatingPoint and CarbonSource.

#### Pair Programming

I believe that pair programming greatly increases the efficiency of developers. I am an experienced team communicator, and thrive when working in and leading development teams.

#### Kanban/ project management

I have organised and led several SCRUM teams, including leading more than 20 people on the carbonsource project.

#### Test-driven Development

I have significant experience with a wide variety of testing frameworks for both unit and feature testing. I have written my own unit testing framework for javascript that can be found on NPM, [tst.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tstjs).

## Projects

### FloatingPoint VR

### Yelp clone

<->

<!-- Makers-yelp is a functionality clone of yelp. I developed it with 3 other junior developers over the course of 5 days. We wrote it in ruby and used all of the standard rails technologies. Our project was written tests-first, and we had extensive unit and feature testing with Rspec and cucumber/ capybara. Check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersyelp). -->

### Airbnb clone

<->

<!-- Makersbnb is a functionality clone of airbnb. It allows users to sign up, create and edit property listings, and request to book other users' listings. I developed this project in 5 days with 3 other junior developers. For our tech stack, we opted to go with node, express and ejs. Our database runs on postgres, and our testing was done with jasmine. Check out the final product [here](http://makersbnb2016.herokuapp.com/home) and the code itself [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersbnb). -->

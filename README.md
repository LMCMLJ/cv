I am an enthusiastic software fanatic seeking to enter the world of professional development in a full time or part time role as a junior developer.  Until now, I have been using my coding skills to contribute to various open source projects, including FloatingPoint, a virtual reality city-building game, and "carbonsource", an early-stage project that (optimistically!) aims to promote environmental accountability among politicians.

I have just graduated from one of Europe's leading development bootcamps, [Maker's Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), and am now looking for a full-time or part-time role as a Junior Developer.

## Skills
Broad experience with advanced software craftsmanship principles and project management techniques. Backend language experience includes Ruby and Javascript, as well as a good understanding of HTML and CSS for the frontend. Hands-on experience developing and deploying full stack web applications, as well as minor experience with server infrastructure and hosting.

#### Agile/ XP
Throughout the last 6 months I have been involved in a number of projects following Agile and Extreme Programming methodologies, including being the SCRUM team leader in projects such as FloatingPoint and CarbonSource.

#### Pair Programming
I believe that pair programming greatly increases the efficiency of developers and thrive when working on team projects.

#### Communication
I am fluent in English, Russian and French, and I have experience working in English as well as Russian.

#### Test-driven Development
I have significant experience with a wide variety of testing frameworks for both unit and feature testing. I have written my own unit testing framework for javascript that can be found on NPM, [tst.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tstjs).

## Projects

### FloatingPoint VR
FloatingPoint is a virtual reality city building game. I led a team of 6 developers over the course of several weeks to produce the initial prototype version of the game, and we will continue development in our personal time over the coming months, leading up to an eventual release on Steam. The game was made using Unity and C#, check out the tech demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFBpKRfyup4). In the game, a player can interact with the whole world around them physically, creating buildings, roads and a multitude of props to create a landscape that can then be explored in first person.

The game features a number of custom-made mechanics, such as a road drawing algorithm and a simple car driving system.

### Yelp clone

#### Tech stack:
- Ruby on Rails
- MySQL
- ERB
- RSpec + Cucumber

Makers-yelp is a functionality clone of yelp. I developed it with 3 other junior developers. We wrote it in ruby and used all of the standard rails technologies. Our project was written tests-first, and we had extensive unit and feature testing with Rspec and cucumber/ capybara. Check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersyelp).

### Airbnb clone

#### Tech stack:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Postgres
- Sequelize
- Jasmine

Makersbnb is a functionality clone of airbnb. It allows users to sign up, create and edit property listings, and request to book other users' listings. This project was also created with 3 other junior developers. For our tech stack, we opted to go with node, express and ejs for extra customisability and a finer level of control over the product. Our database runs on postgres, and our testing was done with jasmine. Check out the final product [here](http://makersbnb2016.herokuapp.com/home) and the code itself [here](https://github.com/calveym/makersbnb).

## Education
- Graduate of Maker's Academy London, a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp.
- Graduate of Wellington College, Crowthorne, Berkshire
- 39 Points in the IB, studying Math, English, Russian, French, Geography and Biology.
- Received 11 7's at MYP level (11 A* GCSE equivalent).

## Interests
Outside of coding, I am an avid mountaineer, skier and adventurer. I have contributed to volunteer research projects around the world, such as a conservation project in Sulawesi, Indonesia where I spent several weeks gathering biodiversity data in the rainforests.
